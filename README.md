# Smart Traffic Management System
## Abstract
Traffic congestion is one of the major urban challenges worldwide. Conventional traffic light systems operate on fixed cycles, which often fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions. The Smart Traffic Management System proposes an AI-driven and simulation-tested solution that dynamically manages traffic signals based on live data, thereby reducing congestion, enhancing commuter satisfaction, and providing priority clearance for emergency vehicles.
The system is demonstrated using a Frontend Dashboard for real-time monitoring and a SUMO simulation to validate efficiency under real-world scenarios.

## Objectives
To minimize traffic congestion at busy intersections.
To provide real-time monitoring and visualization for traffic authorities.
To implement dynamic signal control based on traffic density.
To ensure faster response time for emergency services.
To validate the system using simulation tools before deployment.

## Methodology
Simulation (SUMO): Modeled intersections and vehicle flow to study traffic patterns.
Dynamic Signal Control: Algorithm prioritizes high-density lanes and emergency vehicles.
Frontend Dashboard: Developed an interactive interface to visualize traffic data and decision-making.
Integration: Combined simulation results with dashboard insights for a practical demonstration.

## System Components
Frontend Dashboard: Displays real-time traffic conditions and signal states.
SUMO Simulation: Provides a realistic test environment for evaluating traffic strategies.
Decision Algorithm: Manages adaptive signal timings and emergency priorities.

## Results & Impact
Reduction in average waiting time by up to 10-15%.
Peak hour travel times reduced by ~30%.
Emergency response vehicles reach destinations up to 69% faster.
Increased system transparency with 100% junction visibility for authorities.

## Future Scope
Integration with IoT sensors for live data collection.
AI/ML predictive models for congestion forecasting.
Large-scale deployment in smart cities.
Web applications for commuters with real-time updates.
